Dear Petra and Cedric,

I hope you are both doing well.

Here are my thoughts re. the zoom meeting with Cedric on the subject of DMD-Aligner data transfer:

A. Procedure (please clarify):
   1. Zahnarzt will login on our website.
   2. He creates a folder for a patient.
   3. He uploads patient files there.
   4. He will share it to our "Expert" (Expert will get an email notification.)
   5. Our Expert logs in, and gets the files, and makes the Manufacturing Diagram.
   5b. The diagram is shared to the Zahnarzt, with a document.
   5c. The Zahnarzt signs the document.
   6. Our Expert will share that file/folder to the Manufacturer (Manufacturer will get a email notification).
   7. Manufacturer will then produce the item, and send it to us physically.
   8. We will then send it to the Zahnarzt.

B. We need a basic "file-sharing" plugin for this purpose. 
   - Free versions are limited, but should be quite usable!
   - I have found two, which I will need to check out.

C. Our WordPress website has a built-in "users" database, which is protected by login password and 2FA, and with email notifications.
   - It is a common secure system, which is used generally for sites.
   - We create for each Zahnarzt a special account (on request?).
   - He will then have access to his "own" folder.

D. Notes:
   • Initially we could make a trial this way.
   • Security is handled by the WordPress "User Login".
      - If needed, we could make an audit by a Security Specialist (if it is secure enough for this type of data/work).
      - Some options for better security:-
        1. IONOS security addon - cost: ??
        2. Pro versions of Plugins - cost: ??
        3. Additional security plugins for WP - ??
   • Online Storage of Data:
      - It depends on how big each data is.
      - If we have sufficient space with the IONOS package, and if not we will need to increase space as needed. - cost: ??
   • using DropBox or similar - this might not work, since there could be a folder-management problem requiring manually creating and sharing "user" folders for each "practice" and "patient" etc. (not automated like in the plugin)
